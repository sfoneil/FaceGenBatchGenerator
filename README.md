# FaceGenBatchGenerator
Batch operations for creating many face images in face space

AutoIt v3 Scripting Language

Quick & dirty Windows scripted mouse and keyboard movement for generating hundreds of face stimuli using Singular Inversion's FaceGen software. Software does not support batch operations and can't be easily replicated in other software/closed source.

Current faces are generated in "expression space" slices, which represent the cognitive representation between two expressions and their antiexpressions. These are faces manipulated to be mirrored to expressions across a neutral center. They are not natural but still neurally represented demonstrated e.g. from adaptation.
